<h2>INTRODUCTORY NOTE</h2>

<p>This book was planned and promised to
the publisher more than three years ago.
Exacting duties have compelled the writer
from time to time, to defer the completion
of his undertaking. The delay has been
profitable in that it has afforded opportunity
for the study of recent works on kindred
topics, which in some respects has modified
and in some enlarged the original conception
of the subject in hand. A long ocean
voyage at last has provided the quiet in
which to write out these thoughts.</p>

<h1><i>The Sixth Sense</i></h1>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="smaller">THE SIXTH SENSE</span></h2>

<p>By the Sixth Sense I mean the Mystic
Sense, or that inner perceptive faculty
which distinguishes man from the highest
below him and allies him to the highest
above him. So distinctive among created
objects is it of man that it might, not inaptly,
be characterized as the Human
Sense. It is used for no one exclusive
purpose; on the contrary it is only under
its operation that man’s activities, one and
all, become human. In its nature it differs
essentially from the bodily senses
though we are justified in thinking of it as
a sense because its function is, like them, to
perceive and to afford food for thought.</p>

<p>The five bodily senses originally, in the
first stages of evolution, were, and, in their
ultimate aspect are, one sense—the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
sense of touch. By means of it plant,
mollusc and worm relate themselves to
the universe of which they are a part.
By degrees the single sense, in the evolutionary
process, finds opportunity and occasion
for specialization. Sight is extraordinarily
sensitized touch by means of
which form and color are perceived, and
the distant object comes bowing to our
feet; the stars, leaping across space, are
converted into intimate friends, and
earth’s farthest horizon lies at our door.
Hearing is touch localized and specialized
so as to be capable of perceiving the
vibrations caused by the impact of one
body upon another; its enlarged capacity
classifies sound in such a way as to offer
its mutations and subtleties for our use
and pleasure as the weaver offers his
threads to the loom. Smell is that specialization
of touch, uniquely delicate, supposed
by Maeterlinck to be still in its earlier
stage of development in human kind,
which responds to the stimulus of those
otherwise intangible exhalations called
odor. Lastly, taste is touch specialized so
as to discern the inner properties of food
stuff; taste is the testing sense. Mere
touch determines the existence, specialized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
touch the character and niceties of matter
of the physical universe.</p>

<p>As indicative of the unity of the animal
senses and the coöperative sympathy between
them, it is noteworthy that when one
sense is impaired or destroyed, the others
diligently endeavor to supply its absence,
the entire body playing the part as far as
possible of eye or ear or both, and each
remaining sense growing extraordinarily
acute so as to take on somewhat of the
character of the most nearly affiliated or
the neighbor sense. The blind man can
almost see with ears and hands, the deaf
can almost hear with eyes. The senses
that are left strain, not without a measure
of success, to convey to the brain impressions
for which they are not congenitally
adapted.</p>

<p>The organic differences in the bodily
senses, then, find a close unity in functional
similarity, all the sensory nerves grouping
themselves under the head of touch. The
Mystic Sense, likewise, first comes to our
attention as a simple faculty of perception
by which we gain cognition of that
department of reality that transcends bodily
touch and its sub-divisions, but study
reveals that its unity is ordered complexity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
as in the case of all developed endowments.
Broadly speaking it is the sense
which relates man to the spiritual or psychic
aspect of reality. It puts us into relation
with the spiritual order of which
we are a part. It finds room for exercise,
gains its freedom, and reaches its
highest development in this sphere, beginning
operations at the point where the
bodily senses are compelled by inherent
limitations to halt. It discerns the innermost
character, use, value of the objective,
and differentiates between the human and
the animal estimate of things. Indeed it
has in it that which is not of this world or
order. It soars beyond human and mundane
affairs and steeps its wings in Divine
altitudes where the throne of God is set.
Not only does it perceive but it also lays
hold of and appropriates that phase of reality
which lies beyond the unaided reach,
or eludes the grasp, of all the rest of our
faculties in their happiest combination, and
therefore of any one of them independently.
It takes the material gathered by physical
contact with the world of sight and sound,
and presents it to the mind for rationalizing
operations. More than that, it comes
back freighted with wealth gathered in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
explorations in regions where neither body
nor reason can tread, converting life’s dull
prose into poetry and song.</p>

<p>The most alert and indispensable of endowments,
it is at once sociable with the
remainder of man’s faculties, external and
internal, and jealously independent of
them saving of human consciousness alone.
In its higher stages of development it accepts
suggestions from all, dictation from
none. Its manner is courteous and its
mode of approach one of promptings and
hints. The sphere of every other faculty
is its sphere where it is content to play the
modest part of a handmaiden, never usurping
functions already provided for, although
it has a sphere of its own whither
not even reason can follow. It is supplementary
to all, contradictory to none.
Without its exercise there can be no progress
or growth. It has its origin in a
groping instinct, its final development in
orderly activities capable of increasingly
clear classification. Body, intellect, character,
moral and religious, are under its
influence and dependent upon its beneficent
operations. It plays upon the body, contributing
to its health and efficiency; it gives
wings to the intellect, making it creative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and productive, capable of formulating
hypotheses and venturing upon speculation;
it converts the seemingly impossible into
the normal, bringing moral ideals within
reach of the will, without which improvement
in character would be a matter of
chance; it unfolds the Divine to the human
and forms a nexus between here and
beyond, now and to-morrow, finite and infinite,
God and man. It looks not only
up but down, making the nature outside
of us intelligible to the nature inside of us
and friendly with it. If it peoples the
stars, it also makes a universe of the atom.
It is mysterious, recollective, emotional, intuitive,
speculative, imaginative, prophetic,
minatory, expectant, penetrative. As it
moves up or down with equal freedom, so
it reaches backward or forward, is attached
or detached at will, in its operations.</p>

<p>The Sixth Sense, or, to be more accurate,
the second group of senses, has its specialized
functions, difficult as it is to analyze
with accuracy this most spiritual endowment
of human personality, the inner gift
of touch. It has specializations parallel
to those of the bodily senses. Sight, hearing
and testing are its functions. So clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
eyed is it that it can see with the nicety of
an eye aided by the microscope, so sensitive
to voices that the lowest whispers impart
a message, so critical as to test values with
a precision and swiftness that surpass the
taste and smell which tell us what is sweet
and what unsavory.</p>

<p>If it be argued that I am but dilating
on certain aspects of mind, I am not concerned
to deny that all may be comprehended
under that convenient blanket-word.
But they are as distinct from the rationalizing
media as from the will.</p>

<p>The nearest approach to a satisfactory
substitute for the term “mystic sense” in
terms of the reason is “conceptual reason.”
It furnishes us with the thought of
a faculty which has procreative or generative
properties capable of being fertilized
by intercourse with that which is separate
from and higher than itself. Its first activity
is to lay itself over against that
which, though partaking of its own nature,
is not itself. It is not self-fertilizing
and can conceive or beget only after having
perceived and apprehended.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> It has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
constant regard for an objective and communication
with it.</p>

<p>The operation of the Mystic Sense is
summed up in the single word faith,
which is described as the giving substance
to that which is hoped for, the testing of
things not seen.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> There is no objection to
letting the world faith cover the whole
working of the Mystic Sense, provided it
is not restricted to a severely religious
meaning. It is thus that it is commonly
understood, or at any rate when applied in
other connections it is assumed to be the
working of a different faculty from that
exercised in the sphere of religion. In its
distinctively religious meaning, faith is the
operation of the Mystic Sense in its highest
employment. There is no one faculty that
is reserved exclusively for religious employment.
The fact is that religious faith
is no more separate from the processes of
the Mystic Sense which appropriate health
for the body, hypotheses for the mind,
working principles for the man of action,
and ideals for the character, or independent
of them, than the act of physical perception,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
which enables us to touch the stars, is
separate from that use of the sensory
nerves which relates us to the book we
handle, or independent of it. They are
both the result of a single faculty, or group
of faculties, operating in different altitudes.
Faith will be accepted in these pages as a
philosophic term. Thus we speak of
scientific faith, moral faith, and religious
faith with equal appropriateness, meaning
the Mystic Sense operating respectively in
the interests of the scientific, of the moral,
and of the religious.</p>

<p>The Mystic Sense has for its workshop
the uplands of life in the rarefied atmosphere
of ideas and ideals. It is at once a
super-sense giving us a bird’s-eye view of
the universe which is not permitted at close
quarters, and a sub-sense bringing before
our attention the contents hidden beneath
the surface of things. There are not two
worlds, objective and subjective respectively,
but two aspects of one world—things
as they are in their absolute and ultimate
being, and things as they are relatively
or as apprehended by our cognitive
powers. Our conception of the truth is a
distortion or falls short of the truth, and it
is our aspiration to bring about such a coincidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
as will make the relation of subject
to object perfect. We draw the thing
as we see it for the God of things as they
are now, not to-morrow only, the sole difference
being that to-morrow our painting
will be truer to the original and consequently
more artistic than now. All objective
is immediately reduced by man, by
subconscious or conscious process, into subjective,
so that we may for the sake of convenience
talk of subjective and objective
phases of reality, the subjective being human,
partial, progressive, the objective being
divine, absolute, and final.</p>

<p>There is an objective physical world and
an objective psychic or spiritual world,
the latter being immanent in the former,
though not limited by it, so that every material
object has spiritual contents. The
spiritual is no more an inside without an
outside than the physical is an outside without
an inside. Each has its phase of reality,
though in the ultimate analysis the
physical is dependent for its value upon its
spiritual capacity. The physical has a
non-sensible inside which to be discerned
calls for distinctively human as distinguished
from mere animal powers of perception.
Dimly in animal life there is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
recognition of inner character in objects—hostility,
affinity, nourishment and the like
are instinctively sensed; but here deep perception
stops except where, by reason of
what is called domestication or association
with man, certain human characteristics are
faintly imaged in dog or horse.</p>

<p>There is no antagonism between the
physical and the spiritual. The physical
world is to man a medium through which
phases of the spiritual are reached. The
only antagonism there can be is that which
arises by an attempt to use the material
without regard for its full spiritual contents
or inside. Were not the physical universe
a sacrament it would be a phantasm. If
man divorces the inside from the outside
with a view to gratifying his physical
senses he abdicates his character as a man
to become an animal; if to feed anything
less than his entire selfhood, he presents
the spectacle of arrested development.
The bodily senses alone can get at the full
content, the deep inside of nothing, no matter
how pronounced its objectivity, “The
truly real is a thing that has an inside.”<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
The more pronounced or attractive the external<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
substance and form of a material
object and the closer we are to it, the
greater the difficulty for the average character
to gain cognition of its spiritual essence.
“How hardly shall they that have
riches enter into the Kingdom of God.”<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
Even those who place an undue valuation
upon the material, whether possessed of
wealth or not, have a like difficulty in penetrating
into the internal realm which lies
beneath and around as well as above and
within the external.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> It is absurd for men
to expect to sense the spiritual except with
spiritual faculties. The physical world is
perceived by a sensory apparatus of the
same substance as that of the physical
world; the spiritual world is perceived by
a sensory apparatus of the same substance
as that of the spiritual world. There must
be an inherent affinity between the thing
apprehended and the organ apprehending.
Now the natural man receiveth not the
things of the Spirit of God; for they are
foolishness unto him; and he cannot know
them because they are spiritually proved.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Reality is a term too often confined to
that which can be expressed in terms of
bodily senses; whereas it is that which has
existence in heaven above, in the earth beneath,
and in the waters under the earth,
and which, apart from human perception,
though in a minimum degree or passively,
plays upon and affects man and his universe,
but which reaches its highest potentiality
manward when, by the volitional
operation of human faculties it is subjectively
apprehended and finds permanent
place in his consciousness. Reality is that
which supports and feeds the subconscious
life by the pressure of its mere existence
or laws of being, but which is capable of
bestowing larger gifts in proportion to the
degree in which it receives conscious admission
into the activities of personal experience.
It is a law of spiritual or
psychic, as well as of physical, existence
that every part is related to every other
part and influenced by it through either attraction
or energy. In the case of inanimate
matter mere spacial propinquity or
distance determines the measure of attraction
or energy of object upon object, but
where sentient beings are concerned the
reaction of conscious volition on environment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
is the determining factor regulating
the degree of influence released.</p>

<p>The search for the real in internal processes
cannot ignore the external. Conversely
the activities of the workaday
world cannot summarily dismiss the internal.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
The physical senses have a modest
but indispensable part to play under the
primacy of the Mystic Sense. The normal
use of the Mystic Sense does not make a
mystic. The healthily developed man is
mystical though not a mystic. His dominating
sense is that of the spirit, not that
of the flesh. A mystic, technically defined,
is a specialist in the subjective or internal,
just as a collector is a specialist in the objective
or external. There is no danger
in either extreme except so far as its votary
adopts an exclusive attitude toward its
seeming opposite (which really is its complement),
or toward the balance of human
thought and life. A deliberate and persistent
use of the Mystic Sense without respect
for the objective would be subversive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
of all progress and a reversion to chaos.
“The progress of thought consists in gradually
separating the series of objective and
universally valid, from that of subjective
experiences. In the measure that their
confusion prevails, man is, to all intents
and purposes, mad; and it is this note of
insanity that characterizes medicine and religion
in their early stages. Dreams and
reality are mixed up; subjective connections
are objectified.”<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> If the objective and the
subjective may not be divorced and set at
odds against one another, neither may they
be confused. Both errors would result in
disorder and hopeless perplexity.</p>

<p>The serious crux is how, in the realm
of the spiritual and the physically intangible,
to distinguish between the real and
the seeming, the true and the false. This
it is the function of the Mystic Sense to do
aided by the full complement of inner faculties.
In a measure the Mystic Sense, like
the bodily senses, acts automatically, but
like them it needs special training in order
to separate phantasm from reality, to determine
values, and to grade and classify
ideals until they reveal themselves to be
ordered unity, not less but more mysterious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
because more intelligible or apprehensible
by the whole man. The first principle to
lay down is that no man can treat himself
as a unit or credit the findings of his Mystic
Sense with absolute or final authority
until he has tried them by some valid corporate
test. Neither sight, nor hearing,
nor touch, used without regard to the experience
of others and respect for it, can
fail to lead us astray. The conclusions of
the wisest and the competent register themselves
from age to age, coming to us in
the shape of beneficent authority to prevent
a man from repeating work that has
already been done and well done. Verification
is not contemptuous of authority,
though he flouts authority, indeed, who
ignores it in a process of individualistic experiments.
Pure individualism at best can
apprehend but a fragment of reality and at
worst declines into eccentricity or even insanity.
Those who are really educated
recognize their relation to a social whole
and bring the results of their sense perceptions,
before accepting their verdict, to be
tested by the age-long, man-wide experiences
of humanity as formulated in the accepted
conclusions of their generation and
found in its institutions and customs. Universal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
experience is never wholly but only
approximately infallible, yet accurate
enough to be authoritative for corrective
purposes. By respectful attention to it, individual
judgment is checked in possible
error and at the same time is given opportunity
to offer its own contribution to the
totality of knowledge, a contribution which
may endorse, modify, or enlarge that already
reached. In this way only is society
preserved from becoming a mob of
eccentrics and fanatics, each whirling in his
own little circle. Commerce, art, science,
letters, government, religion—in short
every department of life you can think of
requires such a mode of procedure for the
protection of reality in its varied manifestations
and for the protection of the individual
against himself. But in no conditions
is a social checking off of findings
more essential than in the psychic or spiritual
realm. Mystical experience organizes
itself or is consciously organized in a
sufficient degree to give men that high kind
of freedom which comes to us when we act
with constant reference to the fact that we
are members one of another, so that the
experience of the human race is ours wherewith
to enrich ourselves. A mystic of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
type of St. Theresa, who could hardly see
the objective in her rush past form to reach
idea, could not be distinguished from the
inmate of a madhouse who insists that his
tinsel crown is the diadem of a Napoleon,
unless she interpreted her personal experience
in relation to the spiritual consciousness
of Christendom. “Once,” writes
this saint, “when I was holding in my hand
the cross of my rosary, He took it from
me into His own hand. He returned it;
but it was then four large stones incomparably
more precious than diamonds: the
five wounds were delineated on them with
the most admirable art. He said to me
that for the future that cross would appear
so to me always, and so it did. The precious
stones were seen, however, only by
myself.”<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> A madman would have omitted
the last sentence. Her mystical experience
was individual though it preserved
for its foundation a background of universal
experience. It united her to her fellows,
instead of separating her from them.</p>

<p>The law of use is as applicable to the
Mystic Sense as to the rest of the gifts and
endowments which make up the completeness
of human personality. Its exercise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
enlarges its capacity and quickens its general
efficiency; if used through the whole
range of its opportunities, it becomes a
hardy faculty, trustworthy in every sphere
where its responsibility lies; specialization
of operation in one direction, to the partial
neglect of other departments open to
it, produces acuteness in one direction and
dulness in other directions which is characteristic
of specialists in science; if the
specialization is so exclusive as to shut off
observation and consideration of every interest
but one, there must ensue lop-sided
growth and maimed personality.</p>

<p>It is the purpose of this book to trace
the operation of the Mystic Sense in normal
manhood through the major departments
of human experience in order to encourage
greater confidence in this wonderful gift,
to appeal for a more comprehensive use of
it, and to indicate how it may be cultivated.</p>

<h3>NOTE TO CHAPTER I.</h3>

<div class="smaller">

<p>Von Hügel in his study of the <cite>Mystical Element
of Religion</cite> concludes that there is “no distinct faculty
of mystical apprehension.” In a passage following
this contention (vol. ii, pp. 283, 284), he so states
his position as to make it possible for me to start
from a contradictory assertion and reach his conclusion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
We agree that mysticism is “not everything
in any one soul, but something in every soul of man.”</p>

<p>The entire passage reads as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Is there, then, strictly speaking, such a thing as a
specifically distinct, self-sufficing, purely Mystical
mode of apprehending Reality? I take it, distinctly
not; and that all the errors of the Exclusive Mystic
proceed precisely from the contention that Mysticism
does constitute such an entirely separate, completely
self-supported kind of human experience. This denial
does not, of course, mean that soul does not
differ quite indefinitely from soul, in the amount and
kind of the recollective, intuitive, deeply emotive element
possessed and exercised by it concurrently or
alternately with other elements,—the sense of the
Infinite within and without the Finite springing up
in the soul on occasion of its contact with the Contingent;
nor, again, that these more or less congenital
differences and vocations amongst souls cannot be
and are not still further developed by grace and
heroism into types of religious apprehension and life,
so strikingly divergent, as, at first sight, to seem
hardly even supplementary the one to the other. But
it means that, in even the most purely contingent-seeming
soul, and in its apparently but Institutional
and Historical assents and acts, there ever is, there
can never fail to be, some, however, implicit, however
slight, however intermittent, sense and experience of
the Infinite, evidenced by at least some dissatisfaction
with the Finite, except as this Finitude is an occasion
for growth in, and a part-expression of, that Infinite,
our true home. And, again, it means, that even the
most exclusively mystical-seeming soul ever depends,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
for the fulness and healthiness of even the most
purely mystical of its acts and states, as really upon
its past and present contacts with the Contingent,
Temporal, and Spacial, and with social facts and
elements, as upon its movement of concentration,
and the sense and experience, evoked on occasion of
those contacts or of their memories, of the Infinite
within and around those finitudes and itself.</p>

<p>“Only thus does Mysticism attain to its true, full
dignity, which consists precisely in being, not everything
in any one soul, but something in every soul
of man; and in presenting at its fullest, the amplest
development, among certain special natures with the
help of certain special graces and heroisms, or what,
in some degree, and form, is present in every truly
human soul, and in such a soul’s every, at all genuine
and complete, grace-stimulated religious act and state.
And only thus does it, as Partial Mysticism, retain
all the strength and escape the weaknesses and
dangers of would-be Pure Mysticism, as regards the
mode and character or Religious Experience, Knowledge,
and Life.”</p>

</div>

<p>If my interpretation of this writer be correct, he
terms that a “recollective, intuitive, deeply emotive
element” which I conceive to be a mystic faculty or
sense. The fact that it pervades every part of human
personality does not disqualify it from claiming the
dignity of a distinctive faculty. It bears a similar
relation to the higher endowments of personality
which the ether bears to light and to the call of
world to world. The Mystic Sense is the enabling
faculty, which makes man human. Its pervasiveness
does not detract from, rather does it enhance, its distinctness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
To call it an element seems to clothe it
in a vagueness which its character does not merit.
If man were merely a phase of matter, we could
employ the term element with propriety. That which
<em>can</em> be only an element in a universe, at any rate <em>may</em>
be a faculty or sense in man.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smaller">IN RELATION TO HEALTH</span></h2>

<p>There is nothing so multiple in its composition,
and yet nothing so seemingly simple,
so unit-like a unity, as normal personality—a
normal character englobed by a
normal body. Normality is the product
of a two-fold force, the true interrelation
between the organs of the body and a similar
interrelation between the inner faculties,
culminating in a rhythmic interaction
between the two. The normal man acts
in the completeness of his manhood in all
that he does, never adopting the rôle of
either mere machine or mere ghost. In
so far as the inside and the outside of man
work as a unity, the dignity of human personality
manifests itself; any departure
from harmony approaches that dangerous
borderland beyond which lies disintegration
and disorder. Disease is a lack of
rhythm, a note in the scale out of tune.
Health is harmony.</p>

<p>Up to the time that consciousness of existence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
awakens, the processes of life operate
under the stimulus and protection of
the human and physical environment which
surround the infant. With the immediate
effect of suitable shelter and wholesome
nourishment we are fairly conversant. As
to just what direct or indirect influence
psychic surroundings have upon the subconscious
life of a baby, we are not in a position
to dogmatize, though we can arrive
inferentially at certain rational probabilities.</p>

<p>Apparently the infant, and certainly the
child, is extraordinarily sensitive to subtle
forces. Acting upon this supposition the
Christian Church from the beginning, by
a symbolic and sacramental act, has aimed
to thrust children deep into the bosom of
God by the rite of baptism, and claimed
for them not only a place but a place of
chief importance in the spiritual society.
Instinctively the mother, with exquisite solicitude,
whispers her ideals for the future
of her offspring into the ears of the babe
at her breast, talking as though to one
whose consciousness were awake. In this
way Samuels have been raised to Israel.
At the close of each day the mother bids
her child sleep by singing lullabies and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
hanging mystic poppies over wide-awake
eyes. She speaks in the highest type of
language, in poetry adorned with song, to
this little unconscious scrap of humanity.
In other words her mystic sense is pressing
upon the mystic sense of her child as
naturally and fittingly as her arms fold
the infant body and her lips touch its cheek.</p>

<p>Unless positive proof to the contrary is
adduced, it is safe to believe that it makes
a great difference to the child’s after life
of what sort its psychic environment is during
its first years on earth, whether the
minds about it are healthy, expressing
themselves healthily, whether the tone of
family life is hopeful and spiritual.
Though it cannot finally determine the
course that the child’s life will take, at any
rate it affords the best opportunity for
making it a worthy course. My conviction
is, that the difference between good
and bad psychic environment for a baby
is the same as that between healthy and
unhealthy vegetable environment for a
young plant. An infant abandoned by its
mother to the care of nurses and servants,
be the provision for its animal comfort and
safety what it may, begins life with a minimum
of opportunity. Man is not born<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
mere animal but man from the first breath.
Therefore from the first breath he needs
man’s surroundings. In order that his
latent character may have its best chance,
he ought to be given the most congenial
human environment available. If there is
no conscious self, at any rate there is a
subconscious self, struggling at a very early
moment by baby smiles and frets, gropings
and babblings to utter itself. Psychology
seems to have reached at least this conclusion—that
the subconscious is, that it is
the fundamental part of man, that it is his
most sensitive self, never relinquishing
that which it grasps and grasping everything
that touches it.</p>

<p>Psychic forces may influence mightily
the subconscious life of an infant and promote
healthy character, but have they any
effect on physical well-being? The reply
would seem to be that, if at any time in
the span of a lifetime they work beneficently
in this direction, it is probable that
they do so from the outset. It would be
sheer waste of time to adduce arguments
to prove that healthy minds conduce directly
to healthy physique. The difficulty
is to find the limit of such influence, so vast
is it. Physical well-being, however, is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
an end in itself, and it is a subversion of
the human order to aim at health of mind
or character in order that our physique
may be improved. So nicely is human nature
proportioned and adjusted that it is
doubtful whether a person could achieve
physical health by becoming good with that
sole end in view. Physical health is not
essential to a high degree of human efficiency,
though health of character is and
therefore must be sought first because of
its priceless value. But it is our just assumption
that a child with a healthy body
is more likely to have a normal inner personality
than if it had a sickly body. Outer
and inner health act and react and interact
so that it is equally true to say that, given
a healthy mind and disposition, other
things being equal, the body will have the
best opportunity of being normal and,
whatever its condition, of being used to
the best advantage. There can be no consideration
of higher importance than to
make a child sensitive as soon after birth
as possible, to his psychic, moral, and mystical
environment. It will conduce to loftiness
of character and, for aught we know,
to useful longevity and vigor of physique.</p>

<p>Only soulless animals can be satisfied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
with physical splendor or count muscle sufficient
in itself. Man by virtue of his manhood
can never live according to merely
animal laws. His animal nature itself is
ultimately weakened if he does. In proportion
as he has fine physique he must develop
a fine mind and character. If not, unrestrained
passion and ruin stare him in the
face. The body finds its full meaning
and so its possibilities, only when the soul
has discovered itself and claimed its liberty.
It is then alone that a whole army
of anxieties and fears is scattered, leaving
the body free and joyously adventurous,
ready to identify its movements with those
of the soul. Consequently it is not illogical
or untrue to say that the first requisite
for physical efficiency of a child is to insure
that whatever its subconscious life is
able to drink in should be sweet, wholesome,
and strong. The tone of domestic
life, the character of the child’s attendants,
the whole expanse of human bosom on
which it lies and from which it receives
nourishment, ought to be as near what one
would wish it to be if from the first the
little babe had a conscious as well as a subconscious
self, and were a morally responsible
and not a mere non-moral agent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
There can be a healthy domestic environment
for the keen-eyed, deep-seeing child
only when it has been preceded by a similar
environment for the baby. What the
tone was for the purely subconscious, it
will be for the conscious life when it
awakes. Therefore even though parents
are skeptical of their influence upon infant
subconsciousness, they cannot dispense with
attention to its character if they hope to
bring beneficial pressure to bear on the
child’s conscious life. From the first they
must learn to deal with a baby as a moral
being, impressionable beyond observation.</p>

<p>When we turn to man’s conscious life
and the relation between health of body
and a healthy consciousness we are on more
demonstrable ground. Experience has
proved that our external and internal faculties
work in sympathy with one another.
If the body is distressed, the inner consciousness
droops; if the inner consciousness
becomes morbid or out of sorts, the
body, though not always actually falling ill,
loses in efficiency. Yet, let it be added,
the body is less able to bear psychic illness
than the inner self to bear physical illness.
The body can never turn psychic suffering
into nerve and muscle, but the psychic nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
can weave malady into genius through
the powerful operation of the Mystic Sense.</p>

<p>To be healthy is a commendable ambition.
Being in good health, our desire is
to become as immune as may be to disease,
or being ill to give ourselves the best chance
of recovery. Health is preserved by keeping
body and mind in close relation to
health-giving processes. It is not our concern
to discuss in this connection questions
of diet, sanitation, hygiene, exercise and
similar aids to the promotion of health.
Their value is of the first order and may
not be ignored or discounted. But just
now we are concerned with another part
of human nature which has much to do in
determining our condition of body—the
sense which furnishes us with ideals.</p>

<p>The objective of an ideal is found in
the idea flowing from the mind of God.
It is as real to the Mystic Sense as a flower
is to sight and smell. An ideal is the reflection
of God’s idea and is distorted or
true according as the sense which perceives
ideas is healthy or diseased. The Mystic
Sense relates us to ideas, and enables us to
touch, test, see and hear them, as truly as our
bodily senses enable us to touch, test, see
and hear the world of matter, form and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
sound. A healthy ideal is a vitalizing
force, an unhealthy ideal is an invitation to
disease. Ideals are subjectified ideas.</p>

<p>In the course of the development of that
most experimental of all sciences, medicine,
not only has dosing been reduced to a minimum,
but also the natural recuperative
powers of the patient have been discovered
and are relied upon. The physician tries
to open, for the sick, doors into nature’s
healthiest rooms. The patient being
placed in a vitalizing environment is expected
by the use of his will and Mystic
Sense to respond to it. The physician
alone can do but half the work. The will,
and not only the willingness, to live, a mystical
laying hold of the idea of health, is
in all cases a valuable, in some an indispensable,
factor in the process of recovery.
The suggestion of health predisposes
to health; the suggestion of disease is
provocative of disease. Medicine may be
both a material curative and a sacrament
of health.</p>

<p>The habit of our day has been such as to
create in us a marked pathological consciousness.
The very process which, by
slow degrees, has been driving disease to
the wall, has produced in us a sensitiveness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
to the idea of disease that is inimical to
health. The discovery of the causes of
disease has peopled the imagination, even
of those who have never looked through
a microscope, with an army of hostile germs
to the obscuration of those superior influences
which conduce to well-being, until we
have become chronically nervous of the
hidden perils which beset our path. Insignificant
pains are construed into the
symptoms of the last disease discussed in
the papers or the advertisement of a proprietary
nostrum. Momentary fluctuations
in health send us tripping with anxious
brow to the doctor. Dabbling in pathology
is an undesirable occupation, especially
for the young. The wrappers of
patent medicines, let alone the medicines
themselves, have caused more agony than
peace of mind and have been more provocative
of disease than of health. Happily
we are emerging from the patent medicine
stage.</p>

<p>A therapeutic consciousness ought to be
the normal consciousness. The forces
which make for life are in excess of those
which make for death. The universe
would go into steady decline were not the
dominant forces salutary, and life would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
flicker out like the wick of a candle guttered
in its socket. There is an inexhaustible
fund of vitality open to man and we
are competent to draw upon it so that we
shall receive a maximum rather than a minimum.
Part of the function of science is
to put man into such a relation to the
nature outside of him as to place the wholesome
and remedial at his disposal, preventing
disease by immunizing him from it.
It is the common laws of health which are
the most important. With the curious inconsistency
which characterizes many human
beings, we frequently see men adhering
to some vigorous regimen of secondary
or doubtful importance, while all the time
they are flagrantly disobeying some primary
law of health. The unity between
the outer and the inner necessitates not only
an intelligent and scientific treatment but
also that which is mystical and more or
less mysterious. Prayer, which is at once
an appeal to the Source of Life to let loose
saving health in our direction and an opening
up of our being for the reception of
hidden and unknown aid, is a higher form
of psychic effort than either suggestion or
auto-suggestion in that it includes both,
though not precluding the concurrent use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
of either. Auto-suggestion looks only for
self-induced benefit to the patient by application
to an impersonal ideal; prayer
does not think merely to apprehend a passive
or indifferent remedy, but also to be
apprehended by healthful, forceful Personality,
like but superior to our own. A
prayer to the ether would have in its reflex
effect a totally different influence on the
petitioner from a prayer to what was conceived
to be a personal God. Similarly
the quality of the virtue which is the result
of mere ethical culture is as different from
that which is the product of correspondence
with the Christian’s God as cotton
is from linen. Nor is it that God is inactive
until we pray. He is operating to the
uttermost that our listless or passive or
antagonistic personality will allow. The
highest personality can do his best to
the object of his love only when the latter
adopts a responsive and co-operative attitude.
The feeble spot in much, if not
most, prayer, is that it asks without importunity,
or importunes without appropriating.
The Mystic Sense must reach up until
it feels the hand containing the gift, and
take the gift as its own. Auto-suggestion
is a lame term indicating the application of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the ideal to the defective. Suggestion is a
similar application on the part of another
to a companion. With a background of
prayer, the insomnia patient can with profit
watch the dream sheep go through the
hedge, or lay himself in the cradle of old
nursery rhymes, or welcome to his bedside
the veiled legions of slumber as they troop
forth on their silent errand from the presence
of Him who giveth His beloved sleep.</p>

<p>Faith, which is simply the highest operation
of the mystic sense, is as necessary to
the complete work of healing as in the
days when Jesus said, “According to thy
faith be it unto thee.” It appropriates to
the full the remedial contents of scientific
agencies which, under its touch become sacramental,
and clothes the life in the soft
robe of unanxious peace and serene cheerfulness.
It is easy enough for a well man
to talk to the sick concerning the desirability
and curative value of a therapeutic
consciousness. The depressed soul resents
the necessity of being called upon to act
independently of the body and in opposition
to it. Most patients, too, for the time
being are inclined to count each one his
own case unique. But the Mystic Sense is
wonderfully elastic. Cheerfulness comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
by being cheerful, hope by being hopeful,
calmness by being calm, healthymindedness
by being healthyminded. This is the work
of the Mystic Sense living in the realm of
vigor even when the body is in distress.
When the Mystic Sense goes exploring in
high altitudes it never comes back empty
handed. Even when it fails to return with
health of body, it holds in its grasp health
of mind. A blithe spirit in a feeble body
can accomplish more than a sluggish spirit
in a robust body. There are two kinds
of healthymindedness—temperamental
and acquired. The latter is the most powerful
and may be had by anyone who cultivates
his Mystic Sense.</p>

<p>The extent to which the Mystic Sense
works toward a cure cannot be formulated.
It varies with conditions. Of this we can
be assured. It is always salutary, frequently
indispensable. Diseases caused or
induced by an abuse or morbid use of the
imagination cannot be banished without
the aid of the Mystic Sense as the chief
agent. The imagination must be cured
before the sickness can be cured, and there
are instances when the cure of the imagination
is the cure of the disease. That is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
none the less a disease, the seat of which
is in the psychic, rather than in the physical
part of self.</p>

<p>Two things remain to be said. First,
our day is laying a dangerous accent on
the value of mere physical life in man. It
tends to foster physical self-consciousness
and is an aspect of degrading materialism.
All the efforts being put forth in the direction
of making it possible for the physically
feeble to survive, are dangerous, unless
followed up by commensurate efforts
to make them lit as characters. Mere existence
and mere longevity are false gods.</p>

<p>It is haply justifiable for men of low
breed, who honestly think this life the only
one, to grasp at all its available gifts, and
struggle to retain it on any terms for as
long a period as may be. But not so
among those who have risen to a knowledge
of the meaning of immortality, even
in its lesser aspects, of the perpetuation of
the nation and the race, and the persistence
of a man’s work and influence among men
after he himself has vanished. For such
there is a higher food than mere life, beside
which mere survival looks cheap and worthless.</p>

<p class="noindent">and once more we quote from another

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“Let us, for one thing, never forget that
physical health is not the true end of human
life, but only one of its most important
means and conditions.... Death may
and should be risked, the slow but certain
undermining of the physical health may be
laudably embarked on, if only the mind
and character are not damaged, and if the
end to be attained is found to be necessary
or seriously helpful, and unattainable by
other means.”<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Secondly, special and mystical means of
promoting or regaining health must have
as a background the accumulated knowledge
and scientific skill of the day. If
there are individual exceptions here and
there, they go to prove the rule. We can
no more ignore the history of medical and
chemical science, the findings of the microscope
and laboratory, without disaster, than
we can cut our country off from the traditions,
laws and customs of yesterday without
similar results. On the other hand,
it is at least equal folly to flout or discredit
the mystical experience of the ages.
Human life, individually and corporately,
is a unit, and due recognition must be given
to all that goes to make it up.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller">IN RELATION TO THOUGHT</span></h2>

<p>The mind includes the Mystic Sense in
somewhat a similar way to the manner in
which the body includes the physical senses.
But the Mystic Sense can be, indeed must
be, considered as a distinct faculty having
a peculiar function in the formation of that
product of the mind called thought, which
is “the effort to win over facts to ideas,
or to adjust ideas to facts.”<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The Mystic
Sense can and does operate when the
rationalizing faculty is reverently silent,
and by its operation prepares new material
for pure reason to consider.</p>

<p>There is no specifically intellectual organ.
It is the whole man which apprehends
knowledge just as it is the whole
man and not an exclusively religious part
of him, which apprehends and is apprehended
by eternities and infinities. It is
popularly supposed that science and mathematics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
call for the exercise of one set of
faculties, and philosophy and religion another.
Whereas the truth is that the same
faculties are used for all alike in pretty
much the same relation to one another.
The Mystic Sense is as indispensable to science
as it is to piety. Its method of operation
is precisely the same in the one sphere
as in the other.</p>

<p>We can best appreciate the important
part the Mystic Sense plays in science by a
survey of the foundations of accepted scientific
fact. The whole body of our
knowledge concerning the material universe
is constructed upon a few ultimates,
chief among them being the ether and the
atom. The physical senses, so busy in that
workshop of science, the laboratory, cease
to be important when we deal with these
fundamentals. The discoverer of ether
never perceived it by touch, taste, smell,
sight or hearing. Newton postulated it because
he said it was a necessity, exactly as
we postulate the existence of God. How
could there be attraction across the measureless
spaces which separate worlds if
there were not some intangible substance?
The ether was therefore discovered to order
by the Mystic Sense and accepted because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
it proved a good working hypothesis.
We are solemnly told by physicists that it is
an “elastic solid,” a “pervasive fluid,” a
“tenuous substance.” And yet when we
chase this elusive something into a corner
we find it to be “that which undulates,” a
form of motion—well, so is a field mouse!</p>

<p>Again the atomic theory, first conceived
by the Greeks, was restated by Dalton more
than 2,000 years later, who brought it
down “from the clouds to the laboratory
and factory.” But neither Dalton nor
anyone else ever touched an atom, saw an
atom, heard an atom, smelt an atom, or
tasted an atom, ultimate of matter that it
is. The physicist claims, however, “that
though he cannot handle or see them, the
atoms and molecules are as real as the ice-crystals
in the cirrhus clouds that he cannot
reach—as real as the unseen members of
a meteoric swarm whose death glow is lost
in the sunshine, or which sweep past us
unentangled in the night”—that the atoms
are in fact “not merely helps to puzzled
mathematicians, but physical realities.”<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
All this may be so. Nevertheless both the
ether and the atom are so little material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
as to escape physical perception as completely
as a ghost, and so nearly spiritual
as to be perceived by the Mystic Sense with
sufficient clearness to enable the scientist
to use them as his fundamental hypothesis.
If this reasoning be true, the ultimate of
matter is spiritual and not material!</p>

<p>As with the ether so with the atom, it
was a scientific necessity. The Mystic
Sense contributed it to the laboratory,
where it has been contentedly accepted as
the ultimate of matter, until the other day,
when someone opened the window of the
atom to discover that it was a huge universe,
of which a β corpuscle or electron
was the least particle, related to the atom
as a mote dancing in the sunbeam is to the
room where it is. No sense but the Mystic
Sense has yet sensed the electron. Not
only, then, has science accepted the findings
of the Mystic Sense, but, having accepted
them, it has in the main not had reason to
distrust them and continues confidently to
base its research upon the foundation thus
laid.</p>

<p>The freshest of more recent scientific
discoveries, evolution, is as much the child
of the Mystic Sense as of inductive reasoning.
It was the Mystic Sense of ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
philosophers, exploring the unseen, which
first descried it on the horizon as the sailor
at the masthead spies the distant land.
Darwin was the helmsman who steered the
ship to port. He rationalized it and applied
it as a working hypothesis. It is instructive
to note that Darwin began his
career with a rather acute sense of the mystical.
He had a keen appetite for poetry,
and pictures, and the music in King’s College
Chapel “gave him intense pleasure,
so that his backbone would sometimes
shiver.”<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> He even began preparation for
Holy Orders. In later life the interests
that meant so much to him in youth died.
“My mind,” he says, “seems to have become
a kind of machine for finding general
laws out of large collections of facts, but
why this should have caused the atrophy
of that part of the brain alone, on which
the higher tastes depend, I cannot conceive.
A man with a mind more highly organized
or better constituted than mine, would not,
I suppose, have thus suffered; and if I had
to live my life again, I would have made
a rule to read some poetry and listen to
some music at least once a week; for perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the parts of my brain now atrophied
would thus have been kept active through
use. The loss of these tastes is a loss of
happiness, and may possibly be injurious
to the intellect, and more probably to the
moral character, by enfeebling the emotional
part of our nature.” It would be
more accurate, perhaps, to explain this loss,
not by atrophy but by too narrow specialization.
His Mystic Sense and powerful
imagination were not dead. They were
centred on a single object. Having developed
his Mystic Sense in one or all the
ways open to him, a man may abandon its
use in every direction but one. Christian
worship, poetry, music prepare the Mystic
Sense for that daring creation of hypotheses
characteristic of Darwin. Without
his power of hypothesis he could never have
become more than a mere collector of the
jackdaw order. He is his own best witness
to the truth of this assertion. He
says, “I have steadily endeavored to keep
my mind free so as to give up any hypothesis,
however much beloved (and I
cannot resist forming one on every subject),
as soon as facts are shown to be
opposite to it,” adding that he could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
remember “a single first formed hypothesis
which had not after a time to be given
up or modified.”</p>

<p>It is one of the chief functions of the
Mystic Sense to present hypotheses. Without
hypothesis the reason is a shorn Samson.
A goal must be postulated, otherwise
the wood could not be seen for the trees,
and the intellect would be hopelessly lost
in a tangle of underbrush and smothered
by the weight of its own learning. “While
theory is aimless and impotent without experimental
check, experiment is dead without
some theory passing beyond the limits
of ascertained knowledge to control it.
Here, as in all parts of natural knowledge,
the immediate presumption is strongly in
favor of the simplest hypothesis; the main
support, the unfailing clue, of physical science
is the principle that, nature being a
rational <i>cosmos</i>, phenomena are related on
the whole in the manner that conceptual
reason would anticipate.”<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Generalization
of a tentative character precedes and
gives a starting point for induction. Hypothesis
is more often the child of intuitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
processes which capture thought by quick
assault than of slower and more analyzable
forces. First comes hypothesis, then the
accumulation of data, finally, when all
available evidence is in, rejection and the
adoption of fresh hypothesis, or modification,
or verification. “A bundle of disconnected
facts is only the raw material for
an investigation: their mere collection is
the very earliest stage in the process; and
even while collecting them there is nearly
always some system, some place, some idea
under trial.”<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The spiritual contents of
the physical universe are, in part, evolution,
the ether, the atom and such like. They
bear material names, but they are ideas, out
of reach of our sensory nerves, and capable
of being perceived, first dimly and then
clearly, only through the Mystic Sense.
They form the allegorical department of
scientific thought, and are to the reality as
the Apocalypse is to the Kingdom of
Heaven.</p>

<p>It would be without special gain, however
easy, to multiply illustrations of the
princely place which the Mystic Sense holds
in scientific research. Let us, therefore,
turn for a moment to mathematics with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
array of imperturbable digits and prosaic
facts. No sooner does the mathematician
begin to move, than he finds it necessary
to call to his aid the self-same faculty,
which furnishes the physicist with his ether
and atoms, and enables the worshipper to
pray. Else how could he explore the fifth
dimension, and define a line as having
length without breadth, or a plane superficies
as having only length and breadth,
or a point as having no parts? It
is not astonishing that the mathematician,
“Lewis Carroll,” was the author of
those most delicious imaginative works
of immortal fame, “Alice in Wonderland”
and “Through the Looking-Glass.”
His vocation prepared and
trained him for his avocation, and his avocation
gave him new efficiency in his vocation.
That which made him able to write
the story of dreamland equipped him as an
able scholar—the use in proper relation
to his other mental gifts of the Mystic
Sense. Similarly it is not surprising, but
to be expected that Bacon, Pasteur, and
Kelvin were, each in his own degree, religious
men. They are the normal men of
science, La Place, Huxley, and Haeckel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
being eccentrics and developed in a lop-sided
way.</p>

<p>Invention, to turn to the department of
practical science, relates the same story.
Long before men saw, they dreamed. The
locomotive was a vision before it was a
fact; the aeroplane began as an idea, stinging
men into adventurous experiment, before
it spread its wings above the earth;
men talked across vast spaces in thought
before the earliest cable ticked its message,
or the wireless system enthralled us by its
wizardry. The Mystic Sense is prophetic
and sees to-morrow as though it were to-day,
dimly first and then with increasing
clearness. “Without much dim apprehension,
no dear perception; nothing is
more certain than this.”<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Still once more, when we turn to literature
the Mystic Sense is a pole-star. History
is a museum of the curios of yesterday,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
a pile of bones, a series of occurrences, a
collection of bald facts as cold and bare
as a heap of pebbles, until the Mystic Sense
enters the sterile valley and brings with it
the breath of life. An idiot with a memory
can collect past facts as easily as a wee
toddler can collect shells on the sea shore
and to as good purpose. But it needs a
man who, however vast his stock of information,
possesses a developed Mystic Sense
to classify facts and reveal their insides.
Facts never tell the truth to an unimaginative
mind. There is a higher form of
accuracy and a deeper presentation of reality
than a bare statement. Figures and
prose, taken alone, are blind guides.</p>

<p>In normal childhood the Mystic Sense
gets admirable training through the poetry
and imaginative literature that belongs to
the nursery in every nation. It is justly
considered improper to confine a child’s
education to the multiplication table, scientific
statement, religious dogma, and the
memorizing of historic fact. The kindergarten,
be its merits or defects what they
may, is an endeavor to rouse the young
mind to accurate observation and calculation
through the imaginative faculty. Allegory,
fable, and multiplied illustration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
form the natural vehicle for imparting
knowledge to the young. The abstract is
unintelligible, the bald is uninteresting;
vivid description, poetical and highly colored,
is the main road to knowledge. Care
is taken to introduce fact in its best and
prettiest clothing. Human life has a craving
for the beautiful which is a phase of
strength and an aspect of the real. Literature
is the recorded expression of human
life and thought, colored by the character
of its various authors.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Art is literature
on canvas, in vibrant sounds, and in stone.</p>

<p>Poetry is a necessary and not an ornamental
part of literature. It is to a large
extent the mystical embodiment of prose,
or perhaps it would be truer to say that it
bears somewhat the same relation to prose
that hypothesis does to science. At any
rate it is the distinctive literature of the
Mystic Sense. It is the literature of the
young nation just as much as it is of the
young child. The earliest and the most
permanent literature extant is either poetry
or poetical in idea. Imagination, a child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of the Mystic Sense, which runs wild unless
disciplined, was born earlier than more
sober offspring of the mind. Poetry is the
parent of prose. The habit of the nursery
or schoolroom is the reproduction on a
small scale of the method of history—first
poetry, then prose. He rules a nation
who furnishes it with songs. There
is no firmer foundation for national life
than a great legendary epic or a garland of
folk songs. The better, if not the larger,
part of the Old Testament is poetic.
Even the historical books do not pretend
to be history as Gibbon and Green are history.
Legend and history had not been
distinguished from one another in those
days. Legend is usually elaborately colored
interpretation of fact where the actual
occurrence has been lost in the interpretation,
to such an extent that it can never be
recovered or can only be guessed at. By
subjective process, somewhat akin to reflection
or digestion, the objective gains a new
and transfigured self apart from and independent,
it may be, of the original object.
Thus legend is over-subjectified history.
The outside is ignored for the sake
of the inside.</p>

<p>Poetry and wholesome fiction must find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
permanent place in the life of a normal
man. Do not delude yourself into thinking
that your chief or only guides in life
are logic and sense perception. They are
not. Intuition and sentiment lead you
twice for every once these others do. It is
so much more comfortable, not to say honest
and reasonable, to acknowledge frankly
the primacy of your leaders, than to follow
them and pretend all the while that you are
following other guides, which is a species
of disloyalty. Scientist, inventor, mathematician,
man of letters, alike are not quite
true to fact when they claim that pure reason
and an exclusive process of induction
control their mental operations. I would
raise the question whether there is any such
thing as the exclusively inductive method.
Is it not truer to speak of the deductive-inductive
than of the inductive? The
Mystic Sense, with its adventurous and
sometimes blundering progress, holds so important
a place that without it logic and
induction would be as grist without a mill.
To reach knowledge by “pure reason” is
as impossible as to reach the sun with a
stepladder. Even supposing it were possible
to bring bare reason over against bald
fact, the result would reach only a degree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
beyond the achievement of a pig that
counts, or a jackdaw that gathers a store
of glittering objects.</p>

<p>I have heard scrupulous people complain
of the effect of fairy lore, nursery fables,
and imaginative traditions like that of
Santa Claus, upon child life. It may be a
question to consider, but it is dealing with a
mote rather than with a beam. Cheap
current literature, and the psychologically
false story, which is characteristic of many
of our magazines, are far more of an injury
to heart and mind than the imaginative
excesses of the nursery. The objection
to the latter is not in the substance,
but in the unnecessary attempts to deceive
and to confuse objective and subjective in
the child mind. Santa Claus is a harmless
creature viewed as the Spirit of Christmas.
When he is turned into a chimney god to
whom written or spoken prayers are offered,
it is another matter. Who can withstand
the pathos of the little sister’s death,
resulting from her petition before the fireplace
for a new toy for her baby brother?
The flames took her and turned her into a
burnt sacrifice to Santa Claus.</p>

<p>Supply is usually responsive to demand
and the amount of imaginative literature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
and versifying in the journals of the day is
a fair indication of the appetite for that
which stimulates the Mystic Sense in letters.
Also its hectic character is indicative
of the wild state of the psychic life
of the readers. The normal is counted
uninteresting, and the abnormal, in incident
and character, is portrayed. A
steady diet of such reading leaves unhealthy
blotches, indelible and disfiguring, on human
life. Even in more serious literature
the story of the abnormal may be given
too great prominence. Valuable as the
late Professor James’s <cite>Varieties of Religious
Experience</cite> may be, it has the fault
of studying the abnormal as though it were
the ordinary, leaving the great stretches
of healthy religious experience practically
untouched. If a physiologist were to give
his main attention to men with one green
and one brown eye, or with the heart on
the right instead of the left side, or some
kindred peculiarities, the sum total of his
research would not contribute much to our
knowledge of the normal man.</p>

<p>To conclude: every man who respects
his mind, be his vocation what it may, has
need to guard his Mystic Sense from defilement,
and afford it opportunity for development.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
In what is technically known
as education great stress is laid on proportion
and subject matter. This is no
less a necessity in maturer life than it is
in youth. The same result ensues upon
reading anything that comes to hand, that
ensues upon eating anything that comes
to hand. So important a thing is it, not
only that we should be able to create hypotheses,
but also that our hypotheses
should be sound, that we must furnish our
Mystic Sense with the same safeguards
and stimulus that we afford our physical
senses.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="smaller">IN RELATION TO CHARACTER</span></h2>

<p>Good character is the reaction upon the
whole self caused by the Mystic Sense
as a habit visioning, and the will claiming,
the excellent. It is the result on personality
of a sustained effort to transcend
the existing relation to life and its conditions,
a state of chronic dissatisfaction with
the progress and achievement of the moment,
which makes the good mediocre by
contrasting it with the superior and coveting
the best conceivable as man’s right
and heritage.</p>

<p>The Mystic Sense is always finding a
more excellent way. Excepting when
taught to play casuistical tricks, it does not
look for the conventionally proper, or rest
comfortably in it.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> It launches out into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
that noble freedom which, from a group
of probabilities, selects that which is
farthest removed from suspicion of selfish
considerations and promises ultimately
the best social results. On the
other hand it is not disregardful of the accepted
code of morals. This it takes as
its foundation, individualizing it for personal
use, and boldly submitting propositions
for improvement to the social conscience
for approval, modification, or
rejection. Such approval, modification, or
rejection is never a purely formal matter
registered in the dictum of a tribunal but
rather the culmination of a process akin,
in the moral sphere, to that which is
termed “natural selection” in the physical
sphere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>Character and morality are not synonymous.
Strong character may be good
or bad, the latter being the result of the
active exercise of the will in a conflict with
goodness; it is the transformation of evil
from a mere negation into a positive, personal
force by conscious volition. But our
study is of good character and its cultivation,
so that when the word “character”
is used the determinative “good” is understood.</p>

<p>Character is the result of the correspondence
of personality with the best that
it knows. It is measured by the faithfulness
with which it responds to opportunity.
A man with small opportunity, who
is scrupulously conscientious in availing
himself of all the privilege afforded him,
becomes a stronger character than another,
who, with his great opportunity, is less
loyal in his use of it. Of course the greatest
character is that which knows ideal
virtue and consistently aims to bring up
life to its level. Character is determined
by reaction upon environment, external
and internal. There are many suitable
environments possible for every character,
more than there are unsuitable ones, as the
vicissitudes of most lives testify. Character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
is thus bound up closely with individual
personality and is never abstract, as
morality is in the science of ethics. Character
is created and disclosed by that phase
of experience in which the Mystic Sense is
busied in photographing ideals on the film
monopolized by the actual to the discomfiture
and obliteration of the latter.
Better to-morrows are obtruded on poor
to-days, partly by virtue of the fact that
the Mystic Sense is naturally in constant
contact with the ideally best, sensing and
appropriating it just as the body, without
conscious effort on our part, senses and appropriates
light and air, and partly because,
either feebly or vigorously, most
men claim for themselves by deliberate
volition a larger life than that which is.</p>

<p>The possession of character is the sole
justification of self-respect. Self-respect
ensues upon the growth of character, and
is to character what perfume is to the
flower. It is due to the consciousness of
having within ourselves that which is
worthy—not mere moral acquiescence but
something we have made peculiarly our
own by active effort. It is a high form
of the consciousness which inspires an inventor
when he has constructed a piece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
of mechanism. Self-respect is a witness
to our having been individualized and is
indifferent to external possessions or aught
that is our own by virtue of favor and
chance rather than by merit. Self-respect
runs into self-conceit and stagnation when
it rests content with that which is. It
never dawdles in its movements nor loafs
on the street corners. Self-respect becomes
self-contempt and self-abasement
when our attention is turned from our cherished
ideals and actual progress, and fixed
upon our defects and failures. Penitence
is not a bar but a necessity to character
and its fragrant effluence, self-respect.</p>

<p>Character calls for and expects communal
respect in the same degree that it receives
self-respect. Reputation should
be commensurate with character. It is
possible for men to have the unmerited
respect of their fellows without having
self-respect. This is due to the practice
of deceit, conscious or unconscious, which
enables them to simulate character and
have appearance without corresponding reality.
To the man of character, it is as
truly a pain to be overestimated as to be
underestimated. He can afford to lose
his reputation, though he can never be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
exempt from the keen pain involved. In
the process of achieving character, the
great frequently, if not always, have to
endure the withholding of respect on the
part of the community. Seldom does a
man make a contribution to progress without
being temporarily at least discredited
by those whom most of all he is aiming
to benefit. Self-respect towers at such moments.
A man of character will trust himself
when all men doubt him but make allowance
for their doubting, too; he will
wait and not be tired by waiting, or being
lied about, won’t deal in lies, or being
hated won’t give way to hating.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Ideals become tasks and tasks become
character in social experience. “A talent,”
says Goethe, “shapes itself in stillness,
but a character in the tumult of the
world.” “That which would have remained
only a quality in (our Lord), if
He had stayed in the desert, becomes a
life when He goes forth into the world.”
The ultimate test of a man’s worth is his
character and not his degree of morality—his
power of volitional reaction upon
environment, objective and subjective.</p>

<p>Every man at some time during his career,—most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
men for a considerable portion
of it, and many from beginning to end,—covets
character. Those who fail to
claim it for themselves seldom fail to admire
it in others. Frequently they put as
much effort into pretending they have it as
would win for them the real thing. They
pay the price of gold for tinsel. Character
has commercial value and sometimes
men are honest according to law solely
because it is politic, or polite according
to social requirement because it pays.
But the honesty and courtesy of such
men are not virtues. They are handmaidens
of covetousness. They contribute
nothing to self-respect. They have no
moral content, and serve only to aid in bolstering
up a vicious characteristic. However,
it is a tribute to the kingliness of
character that, either for its market value
or because of its inherent worth, men
clothe themselves in its appearance when
they do not seek the substance.</p>

<p>The substance may be had by every
man. Man not only is, but also acknowledges
himself to be, responsible for what
he is. He makes the confession when he
keeps his worst self from the public gaze
even though it promises him no special<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
gain. The extreme to which the sense of
personal responsibility and accountability
goes is evidenced by the fact that, though
<em>for others</em> we find it difficult to believe
in the closing of the possibility of self-improvement
and ultimate loss fixed and final,
many, perhaps most of us, think and act <em>in
our own case</em> as though <em>we at least</em> shall
be held strictly accountable for our character
and reap as we live. If we had no
responsibility for what we were and did,
there would be no room for shame, were
we to be publicly known to be exactly what
we are. Rob Henley’s poem of its defiant
note and we are in the presence of
sober fact:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“It matters not how strait the gate,</div>
<div class="verse">How charged with punishments the scroll—</div>
<div class="verse">I am the Master of my fate—</div>
<div class="verse">I am the Captain of my soul.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Character, like fruit, gets rich flavor
through living in a climate of extremes
which give robustness by threatening very
existence. The story of the transgression
of Adam and his consort is illustrative
rather than singular. The temptation set
was the very stiffest to which human life,
being what it is, could be subjected—a
demand for self-discipline and obedience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
to mysterious law. It is interesting that
the first recorded strain put upon the human
will was not to do rather than to do.
Seemingly it was the limitation of freedom,
the restriction of choice, the narrowing
of experience. In no other conditions
could man have had a chance to
gain character. Had our first human ancestors
won their day without lapse, every
succeeding generation would have had to
do the same. You cannot inherit character.
You must win it. Temptation is
never eliminated from human life, as we
know it. Its conquest in one form opens
the door to its appearance in another form.
Our earliest human ancestors having
known the higher chose the lower. But
this did not, either in their own case or in
that of their offspring through a thousand
generations, close the door to the attainment
of character. Human life begins in
conditions which threaten character and
therefore becomes eligible for character.
The complaint that there are those in the
world who, because of hopeless environment,
never have an opportunity, finds
sympathetic echo in every heart, but it does
not absolve us from responsibility to our
own opportunity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Much is made of heredity by those who
know little or nothing of the controversies
which gather about the study of its operation.
The popular interpretation presses
hard upon its thorns and forgets even the
existence of its blossoms. “The sins of
the fathers are visited upon the children
unto the third and fourth generation,” is
the dominating thought which, by exclusive
consideration, diseases the mind of
many a man until his whole imaginative
nature is employed in the service of some
congenital, or supposed congenital, weakness
to make him its victim. In this way
fatalism is induced. Fatalism is a disease
of the Mystic Sense which substitutes acquiescence
for reaction. It is the straw
committing itself to the river, not the oarsman
using the current to his own advantage.
Acquiescence is too tame a virtue
for man, if indeed it be a virtue at all.</p>

<p>Whatever credit we give to heredity
for endowing us with the tendencies of our
evil forbears, we must give it equal credit
for endowing us with those of our good
forbears. If you are determined to be
fatalistic, be so fairly, recognizing the possible
transmission of every kind of tendency.
Conscious acceptance of gifts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
strength from the past is a powerful counter-irritant
to defend us against a real or
imagined inheritance of weakness.</p>

<p>The problem of heredity is obscured by
the fog of controversy which just now
envelopes it. We must remember that the
main questions in doubt are its method,
and extent, and our ability to intervene so
as to modify or improve its operations.
Science very cautiously says that “heredity
suggests, though it would be rash to say
it is proved, that man is almost entirely
the product of inborn factors which are
hardly affected by [physical] environment.”<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
“Given parents of certain constitution,
it can be said with confidence
that <em>on the average</em> a certain proportion
of their offspring will have such and such
characters.” “Both [the Biometrician
and Mendelian] agree that what is present
in the germ-cell will be present in the
individual, and that external conditions as
a rule play but a small part in determining
its appearance.” “Almost entirely,”
“hardly affected,” “on the average,” “a
certain proportion,” “as a rule,” form a
relatively large group of qualifying clauses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
in three short sentences. When we know
more certainly the mechanism by which
heredity operates we shall be better able
by eugenics and physiological or mechanical
processes to combat its evils and foster
its benefits. In the meantime there is no
call for us to stand idle. If man were
mere animal it would be another matter,
but he is not. His Mystic Sense, which
links him to a superior order, has steadily
differentiated him from all below him. It
has enabled him to transcend environment.
By means of it he can acquire character
even if the laws of transmission should
forbid him to pass it on to his offspring
by congenital endowment. It is a finer
and stronger thing to improve steadily the
tradition of family or race by a series of
successive personal conquests and achievements
than to gain exemption from evil
tendencies by the more or less mechanical
process of procreation. Release from
temptation is not necessarily a benefit, and
is never as productive of character as the
gift of ability to defeat it. Frequently
all that is needed is inspiration, mystical
and human, to enable a man to rise above
his evil inheritance and habit. Evil tradition
is as real and destructive a phase of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
heredity as inborn weakness, whereas on
the other hand <i lang="fr">noblesse oblige</i>. It is
rather the tradition of the family trait of
intemperance than a transmitted physical
peculiarity that keeps the line of drunkards
unbroken. Children must not be allowed
to suppose that they can be excused from
struggle. Being prepared for all temptations
as a normal part of experience they
are least likely to become victims of any:
being made expectant of all virtues, they
may perchance glean some.</p>

<p>Our environment is our opportunity,
particularly in those spots where it is uncongenial
and threatening. To chafe and
fret is to increase the inimical possibilities
of difficulty. To think of it except with
the intention of mastering it is weakening
and depressing. To remove it with our
own hands rather than have another remove
it, if it be moveable, or, should it be
immoveable, to weave it as material into
our scheme of life, using its rough threads
to the last stand, is to achieve character.
A man must either fit his burden to his
back or his back to his burden, if he desires
to remain man. They are rare exceptions
in mankind who have not capacity
for so doing, if not by themselves, at any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
rate in a sympathetic social setting. A
burdened life by the free use of the Mystic
Sense may become a privileged life. Introduce
fearlessness and experimental curiosity
into hardship, and you get romance
which keeps the wings of life moving and
mounting, and makes the world of men
around look up in aspiring wonder.</p>

<p>The Mystic Sense has an inner ear.
Through it conscience delivers its message
by means of which we come to know and
understand the meaning of ought and
ought not. Ready response to conscience
is to be coveted above all things, especially
where conscience has been trained and
illumined. A friend once wrote me, a few
days before his death, that he had come
to see that what pretended to be education<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
was no education at all unless it included
the development of conscience. But mere
knowledge of right and wrong, ought and
ought not, does not impart goodness. To
be aware that vice injures and virtue
blesses is desirable but insufficient. There
is not less vice among those who know
than there is among those who do not
know ethics, other things being equal, excepting
where education is conceived to
be something more than the imparting of
information.</p>

<p>Sometimes nations and individuals covet
character without being ready to pay the
whole price for it. They give admirable
facilities for the development of certain
phases of training essential to character,
but exclude that deciding factor which determines
whether or not they may be
woven into character. Influences from
other sources may come in to repair wilful
neglect, but, if not, the training goes
for nothing so far as character is concerned.
Public schools can never give
character its best opportunity without a
practical recognition of religion. Purely
secular education, the imparting of learning
including the science of ethics, without
religion in church and home to supplement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
it, is a doubtful blessing at best. The current
idea of secular education is not new.
During the French Revolution its leaders
mapped out what appeared to be a satisfactory
programme of instruction. It was
desired to have moral training, first without
religion or with the “Worship of
Reason,” then with a minimum of religion.
The priests were suffered to continue
as being at any rate moral policemen, but
Danton planned to supplant them by <i lang="fr">officiers
de morale</i>. All experiments were
of no avail. “<i lang="fr">La morale populaire
... cherche encore</i>,” it was pathetically
complained, “<i lang="fr">un point d’appui
solide</i>.” Then came freedom to worship,
and later the Concordat reintroduced the
old religious order, partially, it is true, because
the people could or would not live
without it, but largely for the sake of
morals.</p>

<p>If religion without morality becomes
superstitious sentiment, morality without
religion becomes for the average man inoperative
ethics and ultimately a pitiless
judge. There is no more oppressive tyrant
than a high ethical code with a will,
untrained, uninspired, and helpless to respond.
It becomes a mocking and cruel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Nemesis viewing with indifference its
writhing victims. The Chinese Classics
are preserved by the wonderful nation who
produced them, as a literary treasure instead
of as a practical code of conduct—the
sure fate of the Bible apart from the
Christian Church.</p>

<p>It is too late in the day to pretend that
morality and religion are synonymous,
however intimate their relationship, or that
the end of religion is to make men good.
Righteousness, which is the Christian term
for morality, is to be had only in part by
the practice of embracing the excellent and
bathing our mystic self in the fountain of
ideals. The type of righteousness thus
created can never be aught than self-conscious,
like an overdressed woman, or a
gaudy painting. The Mystic Sense must
occupy itself in still higher altitudes.
Having come from God and being partaker
of His nature, it must aspire to Him.
The end of life is religion, and the end
of religion is to know God. The purest
type of righteousness, experienced
or conceivable, is created by our having as
our dominant ambition to know the only
God and Jesus Christ whom He hath sent.
The net result is Christian Character.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="smaller">IN RELATION TO RELIGION</span></h2>

<p>The operation of the Mystic Sense in relation
to religion is commonly called faith.
Conversely, faith under another name is
that operation of the Mystic Sense which
promotes health of body, which affords a
starting point for all intellectual, scientific,
and other productive pursuits, which leads
character from strength to strength. The
subjective conditions under which, and the
spheres in which, the Mystic Sense is employed,
differ. But the faculty itself and
its <i lang="la">modus operandi</i> are always the same.
Just as the sense of bodily sight which
views the dirt beneath our feet is the same
sense which contemplates the blue sky, so
the inner sense of sight which perceives
an electron, an ideal, or a hypothesis is the
same sense which sees God. It is as possible
to see God as to see a hypothesis, and
as possible (not more and probably less),
to see a hypothesis as to see God.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>It is fitting that the most exalted operation
of the Mystic Sense should be dignified
by a distinctive term, provided that in so
doing no room is given for the implication
that there is a faculty, or set of faculties,
used in religion alone. A man has religious
capacity because he is man, and not
because he is a specially favored individual
of his kind. Man, unless he abdicates
his manhood, a task so difficult as to verge
on the impossible, must live by his Mystic
Sense; he must keep touch with the unseen,
or cease to be a man. To be a man,
rounded and proportioned, complete and
splendid, he must use his Mystic Sense not
merely here and there but everywhere.
The Mystic Sense has as true an existence
in the whole personality, and relation to it,
as the physical sense of touch, and is as
acutely sensitive to the stimulus of the
spiritual phase of reality as the body is to
that of the material. It is analogous to
all the sub-divisions of the nervous system
but chiefly to sight and hearing, the most
distinguished of the senses.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>To perceive an ideal is as real a sensation
as to look at a flower. An impression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
is left behind not unlike the photograph of
the flower retained on the retina of the
eye and revived by act of memory and
will. But the visualizing has nothing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
do with physical sense perception, and the
part of the personality thus impressed is
spiritual. To characterize tactual sensation
of the body as real necessitates a like
characterization of the tactual sensation of
the spirit. If it be argued that in the
latter relationship there is no certainty as
to what is phantasm and what reality, let
it be remembered that the history of science
is largely a series of corrections of
imperfect sense records. A highly developed
power of observation with ability for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
accurate registration and correlation is the
distinguishing feature of culture. The
Mystic Sense, like the bodily senses, is capable
of increasingly accurate perception
by skilful and disciplined use. It takes
its beginnings in gropings like the awkward
jerks of a baby’s limbs, and develops
into ordered and reliable movement by
exercise and experiment, which includes mistakes
and the profit accruing to the experience.
Superstition bears the same relation
to faith that a false scientific hypothesis
bears to ascertained fact. The Mystic
Sense in its infant working catches a
distorted view of the ideal, as when Darwin
propounded his conception of heredity
by pangenesis, and leads us astray in
science; in like manner in religion a
glimpse, through a mist of ignorance and
moral deficiency, of the Absolute, eventuates
in superstition. Both are necessary
stages in the training of the Mystic Sense.
Similarly to the way in which the theory
of pangenesis stimulated discussion and
research so as to aid the Mystic Sense to a
more accurate perception of the true hypothesis
of the manner of heredity, the
superstitions of the nations conceived in
sincerity, crude and even repulsive though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
they be, have contributed to the complete
knowledge of God and His character
which forms our most valuable heritage.</p>

<p>It is not hazardous to say that the ideals
and hypotheses which are still waiting for
the cognition of the Mystic Sense transcend
gloriously those thus far apprehended.
This means that science is in its infancy.
It is equally true to assert that religion,
so far from having fallen into decline, is
but girding itself to scale heights impatient
to feel the tread of human feet. That
which is good and true in itself must persist,
whatever its crudeness and blemishes.
The Mystic Sense in relation to religion
is only at the beginning of its history.
Human, that is mystic, life began at so remote
a period as to be beyond the reach
of research. The operation of the Mystic
Sense through many thousands of years<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
prior to human records led the way to that
ordered approach to God which we call
religion. The possibilities of its growth
for the race at large are indicated and emphasized
by individual instances taken from
the common crowd. The world is just at
this moment engrossed in seeing that every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
one should have an opportunity of developing
fine physique and of acquiring information.
It is assumed that under proper
conditions a high average may be reached.
The same is to be postulated for the development
of the Mystic Sense in relation to
the highest and best in religion. Under a
sufficient stimulus the average man will be
able to apprehend what now is reached
only by a minority. This, however, can
not come to pass until a whole world of
men strain their inner eye and quicken
their inner ear in the same direction, each
contributing of his own strength to the rest,
and all to each.</p>

<p>The history of Christianity and its immediate
progenitor, Judaism, is the record
of the highest development of the Mystic
Sense in religion. In the course of its
progress the Absolute rises from a dim
shadow to the greatest Reality. It is distinctively
the religion of orderly and rational
mysticism. At first, men, feeling
the working of the Mystic Sense, used it in
a childish way. What was splendid in
them would be culpable in us. Abraham
could consider it a call of God to slay his
son: a man of to-day could only think of it
as a monstrous crime against God and society,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
revolting even to contemplate. It
marked a stage in the rationalizing of faith
when at the last moment Abraham saw
mystically that it was not God’s purpose
that any human being should ever do at
His bidding an inhuman deed.</p>

<p>The most perfect individual life of faith
ever lived was that of Jesus Christ. His
Mystic Sense never erred. He was never
so exclusively Divine as not to be completely
human. He was God living the
life of man. He walked by faith, not by
sight. Visions and ecstasies found rare
and momentary place in His experience.
He reached His goal by the use of those
gifts and endowments which we have in
common with Him, and proclaimed forever
to the race of men that it is the simple,
steady, patient exercise of the Mystic
Sense toward a God who is revealed as
Love, which exalts human life and puts it
in the way of winning incomparable power
and beauty. His reply to the query, What
shall we do, that we might work the works
of God, is, This is the work of God, that
ye <em>believe</em>—believe on Him whom He
hath sent. Further, He makes the astounding
prophecy, Assuredly I announce
that he that believeth on me, the works<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
that I do shall he do also; and greater
works than these shall he do. The early
Christians were distinguished from their
fellows as men who exhibited in high degree
the faculty of belief so as to be in a
unique sense “Believers,” and their religion
was one in which faith played so
prominent a part as to merit the name of
“The Faith.” The whole Christian era
has been an era of faith or the exercise of
the Mystic Sense. No great work can be
found in it, in science, literature or religion
which has not been made possible by the
stimulus given to faith by the influence of
Jesus. Miracles do not cease to be miraculous
when they cease to be mysterious, and
the Christian centuries are strewn with such
miracles—many of them, works of healing
and moral restoration, as great as those
of Jesus. But the greater works than His
still lie before us when we have sufficiently
shed materialism and committed ourselves
more implicitly to the life of faith.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>The disappearance into the spirit world
of Jesus has made that world human,<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> so
that the Mystic Sense can be as truly at
home in it as it is in scientific research.
He prepared for His withdrawal thither
by centring the attention of His friends
upon it. His manifestations after His
death on the cross were primarily to the
Mystic Sense of His followers. That is
to say, those unaccustomed to use the Mystic
Sense in a religious way were incapable
of seeing Him. It was impossible for
Him to show Himself to the irreligious or
enemies of God. This does not mean that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
it was only to the Mystic Sense of believers
that He manifested Himself, but also to
their bodily senses by way of the Mystic
Sense. There is much that comes to the
cognizance of the Mystic Sense through
physical perception, and unless there is a
refined and cultured nervous organism
there is no mystical connotation. A Peter
Bell could not find the mystical in nature.</p>

Conversely, there are some things which
cannot affect our physical being except by
the way of mystical experience. Striking
instances of this sort have been suitably
termed by von Hügel “psycho-physical.”
They are possible only where there is extraordinary
sympathy between the mystical
and physical, the latter having been made
very completely the servant of the former.
Only the mystic, or the specialist in the
use of the Mystic Sense, is eligible for such
experiences. The tremendously real fellowship
with the Risen Lord of the disciples
was of an ecstatic or psycho-physical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
order. It degrades the Resurrection manifestations
to overemphasize their physical
reality as though this, rather than the
mystical, were the important feature.
Their dominant note is spiritual. The
physical perception came through the mystical.
The experience of the disciples
could not be reproduced in after times with
other men, for the necessary conditions
were wanting. Here and there among
spiritual giants there is a well authenticated
psycho-physical experience, but it is of
phenomenal rather than of spiritual or
moral value. And yet it is within our
power to see the Christ as really and effectively
as the Apostles did, though not
wholly after the same manner.</p>

<p>St. Paul did not begin his life of faith
when he had his psycho-physical experience
on the road to Damascus. He reached
there a turning point in its history. He
was converted, turning his mystic powers
in a new direction. Those who were with
him were not sufficiently developed to see
all that he saw or hear all that he heard.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
His vision of Jesus was momentary but
his life of faith was continuous. If faith
was at its beginning when Abraham made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
his venture, it reached an illustrative and
inviting climax when St. Paul made his.
It was greater for St. Paul to espouse the
cause of the Christ than to have a vision
of Jesus. The phenomenal or extraordinary
does not always culminate in such
courage and devotion as his. It was because
he was a mystic that he had his vision,
not because he had a vision that he became
a mystic. The Apostles who knew Jesus
in the flesh had a lesser opportunity for
faith than St. Paul who saw Him but once
and then after psycho-physical fashion, and
who never apprehended Him with all his
bodily senses like those who saw “with
their eyes” and “beheld,” and whose
“hands handled” the Word of Life. It
was fitting that St. Paul should give Christianity
the impetus which made it a world
religion. The highest development of
faith has assigned to it the biggest undertaking.
St. Peter with undeveloped intellectual
gifts and faith based on sight could
not do what St. Paul with highly developed
reason and singular faith could do. The
Risen Jesus Himself declared that faith
dependent upon physical or psycho-physical
experience is of a lower order than that in
which the mystic sense is independent of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
phenomenal action of the bodily sense—Because
thou hast seen me, thou hast believed:
blessed are they that have not seen,
and yet have believed.</p>

<p>The great multitude of mortals will always
be outside of psycho-physical experiences.
There is no religious loss in the
fact. Rather the contrary. That which
gives the soul its permanent hold upon
moral and spiritual realities and regard for
them in mystics is not their rare psycho-physical
experiences, but the same exercise
of the Mystic Sense in the daily round of
commonplace religious duty which is open
to every human being, with like wonderful
results upon character. A phenomenal
spiritual occurrence in the case of one who
was not living a religious life would be a
mere wonder, perhaps even productive of
spiritual harm.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Such experiences are
never to be sought for. If they come
their peril is not less than their inspiration.</p>

<div class="verse">“The trivial round, the common task,</div>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">It is a great barrier to religious effort
among the crowd, for those living the life
of faith, to give the impression that their
experience is one of a series of ecstasies.
It is no more so than is that of a student
of science or higher mathematics. It is
the life of faith open to all men which
forms the religious life of the best men
and the best religious life of all men—the
constant placing of God before the
Mystic Sense in a way not dissimilar from
that in which the scientist approaches his
hypothesis.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Think not the Faith by which the just shall live</div>
<div class="verse">Is a dead creed, a map correct of heaven,</div>
<div class="verse">Far less a feeling fond and fugitive,</div>
<div class="verse">A thoughtless gift, withdrawn as soon as given;</div>
<div class="verse">It is an affirmation and an act</div>
<div class="verse">That bids eternal truth be present fact.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Though the Mystic Sense is not the sole
religious faculty, it holds the primacy here
as in every distinctively human activity.
Used with reason its operation becomes
reasonable or rational faith. Its opposite
is not reason but sight, that is to say, the
unaided findings of the bodily senses of
which sight, being the most princely, is
representative. Hence St. Paul’s contrast—we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
walk by faith, not by sight.
Even here it is hardly fair to say there is
antagonism. Sight is the enemy of faith
only when it refuses to be an ally. Sight
sees, faith in-sees and therefore fore-sees.
Sight has boundaries which it cannot
pass. Faith has horizons which retreat
as it advances.</p>

<p>Faith has become increasingly rational
as the world has grown older and experience
has been added to experience. Its
explorations in the world of ideals have
been more frequent and daring with the
advance of time. Consequently the man
of to-day makes his flights thitherwards
with a fulness of assurance on rational
grounds or grounds of high probability
which would have been impossible to an
Abraham. If the triumphs open to faith
have multiplied, so have the deterrent forces
holding it back or set in battle array to
thwart or otherwise impair it. The commonest
injury wrought upon faith is the
deflecting of it from the worthy to the
unworthy or less worthy. If a man’s
Mystic Sense, acute in other directions, is
dormant or sluggish in religion, the reason
is usually to be found, I think, in circumstances
analogous to those which make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
student of <i lang="fr">belles lettres</i>, for instance, indifferent
to science, or a philosopher careless
of the exploits of commerce, cases of
which are not wanting. The mind finds
higher pleasure among certain persons in
being exclusive and technical than in being
catholic. So the Mystic Sense can fall
short of its highest employment simply because
there is not in its possessor the will
to employ it commensurately with its capacity.
The explanation why some men
are not actively religious must be sought
elsewhere than in the contention that they
are short a faculty. The Mystic Sense,
which by virtue of their humanity they
possess, is not employed by them religiously
from whatever reason—defective
interest, prejudice, antagonism, environment.
Nevertheless the same inner sense
is pushed to its fullest activity in other
directions. The faculty which by a daring
leap fixes on the evolutionary hypothesis,
or with imaginative subtlety suggests the
plot of a novel, is the self-same one which
enables us to say, “Our Father, which art
in heaven.” The consideration of vicious
men who are irreligious does not come
within the purview of this discussion. Religion
and vice are mutually exclusive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
though piety and immorality are not, so
that we have the anomaly of immoral character
revelling in pious practices.</p>

<p>One thing remains to be said. The use
of the Mystic Sense in religion, more perhaps
than in any other sphere, cannot begin
and end in individualism. It is
requisite for each to submit the results
of his mystic excursions and explorations
to the conclusions of the most advanced
religion. Mystic observation and experience
must have the support and purification
of universal mystic experience that
will distinguish between the false and the
true, phantasm and reality, and deliver
the individual from eccentricity and extravagance.
In other words, a church is
more necessary than a chamber of commerce,
a national government, or an academy
of science. Mystic experience must
be organized like all other experience.
As the world grows older and man wiser,
organization develops and broadens. National
societies and alliances become international
and a parliament of man seems
a reasonable goal toward which to press.
Human life in its individual aspect finds its
fullest freedom in organization and not
apart from it. The idea of the Catholic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Church is as old as Christianity. One
Body, one spirit, one Lord, one Faith,
one Baptism, said St. Paul before Christianity
was fifty years old—and the use
of the Mystic Sense independently of organized
Christian experience cannot hope
to reach valuable results. Reformers of
religion are eccentrics and detract from
their service so far as they ignore the religious
experience of the ages by assuming
exclusive positions or lifting a doctrine
out of its setting. Our Lord never broke
with the faith of His fathers. His last
act was to partake of the Passover according
to the law. It was the Jews who
broke with Him. He came not to destroy
but to fulfill. The only setting for any
one part of the truth is all the rest of the
truth. The only relationship big enough
for any one man is all the rest of mankind.
When at last the disturbed and
broken Christian Church comes to rest in
the large scheme of unity planned by its
Founder, then the mystical life of man
will gain a power and splendor which now
is but a vision and a hope.</p>

<p class="tb">This concludes my endeavor to credit
the Mystic Sense with that dignity and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
position of importance which belongs to
it by right. The attempt is crude and the
brilliant vision which I had at the beginning
of my task has become dimmer under
the process of putting it into words.
Whatever has been written stands as a
contribution of thought and experience
which cannot be of much value until it has
been purified from the dross of individualism
through the findings of religion and
science, and lost in the great volume of
truth to which I submit it with reverence
and loyalty.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The idea underlying the Beatific Vision is the complete
apprehension of God by the complete man.
Sight is chosen to denote this bliss because it is a
princely co-ordinating sense, and our Lord spoke of
the heritage of the pure in heart as being the vision
of God, a heritage let it be noted, however, for now
and not merely for hereafter. It seems reasonable to
suppose that our powers of perception after death will
be those mystic powers which we enjoy and use now,
though then they will be rapidly developed as being
our only perceptive powers.</p>

<p>This suggests the investigation in progress of
psychic phenomena by scientific methods. The result
may lead to an increase of our knowledge regarding
the nature of such phenomena. But I do not
see how, if communication with the departed be possible
at all, we can expect to reach, and be reached
by, them except through the Mystic Sense. The invocation
of Saints seems to me more in line with
what is probable than some of the experiments of the
day. Disembodied spirits presumably approximate
the nature of God and can approach or be approached
only after a purely spiritual or mystical
fashion, excepting in those rare psycho-physical instances
which are themselves contingent upon a
highly developed mystical character and experience.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_26" id="Footnote_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> Two things must be remembered in connection
with the interpretation of Jno. xiv ff. In the first
place, these chapters, bursting as they are with
startling promises which the critic claims have not
been made good, were addressed to a select and
specially trained group of followers. For instance,
Whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do,
constitutes a promise that could not have been made
to a heterogeneous crowd. It presupposes an understanding
of the mind of Christ that keeps prayer
within its appointed limits. A promise of this sort
made to a St. John would be fulfilled, whereas it
could not be fulfilled in the case of a man who
thought that a prayer for the success of his lottery
ticket, or the triumph of a competitive business scheme
stained with dishonor, might be offered in the name
of Jesus. In the second place, these chapters were
written down and became accepted Scripture not
less than three quarters of a century after they were
spoken, by one who, in common with like-minded
companions, had experienced the faithfulness of our
Lord’s promises. These men knew them to be true,
not merely because our Lord had said them, but also
because Christian experience, had verified them. This
is so of the entire Gospel record. That was remembered
and recorded which <em>Christian</em> experience had
verified.</p>

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
